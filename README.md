### Data
* [SLTT IC3 Data - 2019](https://github.com/internetassociation/SITARA/Data/IA_SLTT-IC3-Data_2019.xlsx). This is an Excel sheet that includes data to generate the "IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks" metric. Using information released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and using Census data, all the 2019 data points are normalized to generate a "per million" statistic that can be used to determine whether a state is above or below the national average.
