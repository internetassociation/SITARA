# Ohio SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Flag_of_Ohio.svg/520px-Flag_of_Ohio.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 12 out of 21

Ohio received **12 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with three states receiving the same number of points (12 out of 21) as Ohio.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 5 out of 7

**Ohio has an established cyber security posture.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, has a appropriated several million towards their cyber security budget, has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million, and has a statewide strategic approach towards IT security. With a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve this metric.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There are millions being spent on cybersecurity initiatives but there is no dedicated line item, making it difficult to ascertain the full amount (see [Budget](https://archives.obm.ohio.gov/Files/Budget_and_Planning/Operating_Budget/Fiscal_Years_2020-2021/BlueBook_BookOne_BudgetRecommendations_FY20-21.pdf)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (5.39) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy document, but a section of the [Technology Strategic Plan](https://das.ohio.gov/Portals/0/DASDivisions/InformationTechnology/IG/IT%20Innovation/IT%20Innovation%20Strategic%20Plan.pdf?ver=2020-07-27-093920-357) proposes the development of one and the [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.ohiosos.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/) as well as the [Ohio Cyber Collaboration Committee](https://ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/site/government/resources/adj-cyber) indicates a high level of strategic thinking about the issue to a degree that warrants recognition. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 2 out of 6

**Ohio could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud-centric strategy outlined in the State of Ohio IT Optimization Case Study and a focus on cloud enablement in the 2020-2022 IT Strategic Plan , and there is a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [IT Procurement Rules](https://das.ohio.gov/Divisions/Information-Technology/Ohio-Statutes-and-Administrative-Rules)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a cloud-centric strategy outlined in the [State of Ohio IT Optimization Case Study](https://das.ohio.gov/Portals/0/DASDivisions/InformationTechnology/IS/Optimization/Transforming%20State%20Government%20-%20IT%20Optimization%20Case%20Study.pdf) and a focus on cloud enablement in the 2020-2022 [Technology Strategic Plan](https://das.ohio.gov/Portals/0/DASDivisions/InformationTechnology/IG/IT%20Innovation/IT%20Innovation%20Strategic%20Plan.pdf?ver=2020-07-27-093920-357). | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://das.ohio.gov/Divisions/Information-Technology/State-of-Ohio-IT-Service-Catalog) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 5 out of 8

**Ohio has a strong foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the codified InnovateOhio program , supported by the IT Innovation team, and it meets two of the three factors of a modern digital government experience. If the CIO had a direct line to the Governor or was a member of the Governor’s cabinet, the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for even more effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is an Innovation Focused Group in the [IT Innovation](https://das.ohio.gov/Divisions/Information-Technology/IT-Innovation) team, which supports the Office of Innovation (InnovateOhio), and it is created by statute (see [107.71](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/107.71v1)) while also being supported by Executive Order (see [2019-15D](https://governor.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/governor/media/executive-orders/2019-15d)). | 2 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | The [IT Innovation](https://das.ohio.gov/Divisions/Information-Technology/IT-Innovation) team focuses on making all public services more accessible (see [projects](https://innovateohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/innovate/priorities)) and provides regular updates on their work. | 2 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://das.ohio.gov/Divisions/Information-Technology) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://das.ohio.gov/Divisions/Information-Technology) does not report to or works directly with the Governor as they are under the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) (see [125.18(A)](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/125.18)). | 0 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 8
