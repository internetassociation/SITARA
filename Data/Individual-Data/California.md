# California SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Flag_of_California.svg/640px-Flag_of_California.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 13 out of 21

California received **13 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Very Good**. Only two other states achieved the same ranking of Very Good, with one state receiving the same number of points (13 out of 21) as California.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 4 out of 7

**California has an established cyber security posture.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has a $40M cyber security budget (which is the highest in the country). However, the state does have more than the average number of ransomware attacks per million, and while it has a statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in the Vision 2020 IT Strategic Plan , it is expiring. With a new IT security strategy that is continuously updated, and greater awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve this metric.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $40.8M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [2020-21 Budget](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4176)). | 2 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (7.67) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 0 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is a Statewide IT Security Strategy discussed in the Vision 2023 [IT Strategic Plan](https://vision2023.cdt.ca.gov/), but there is no independent IT Security Strategy. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 2 out of 6

**California could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud-first policy in TL 14-04 and a focus on cloud enablement in the Vision 2020 IT Strategic Plan , and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Chapter 3](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PCC&division=2.&title=&part=2.&chapter=3.&article=) and [Chapter 3.5](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PCC&division=2.&title=&part=2.&chapter=3.5.&article=)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a cloud first policy outlined in [TL 14-04](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/PD/Resources/Page-Content/Procurement-Division-Resources-List-Folder/Cloud-Computing-Policy) and a focus on cloud enablement in the [Vision 2023 IT Strategic Plan](https://vision2023.cdt.ca.gov/). | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://cdt.ca.gov/services/) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 7 out of 8

**California has a strong foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the codified Office of Digital Innovation , there are all three factors for a modern digital government experience, there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO has a direct line to the Governor. If the CIO was a member of the Governor’s cabinet, the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for even more effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | SOURCE | 2 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | SOURCE | 3 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://cdt.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CDT-Org-Chart-Names-Titles-Only.pdf) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://cdt.ca.gov/director/) reports directly with the Governor but is not part of the cabinet as DOT is under the [Government Operations Agency](https://www.govops.ca.gov/) (see [org chart](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Exec-Branch-Org-Chart-6.1.20.pdf) and [Chapter 5.6](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&division=3.&title=2.&part=1.&chapter=5.6.&article=)). | 1 out of 2
