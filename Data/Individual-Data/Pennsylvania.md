# Pennsylvania SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg/640px-Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 8 out of 21

Pennsylvania received **8 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with nine states receiving the same number of points (8 out of 21) as Pennsylvania.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 3 out of 7

**Pennsylvania could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has a $440k cyber security budget . However, the state has more than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, and greater awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve this metric.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $440k available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see Line Item 57 in the [Budget](https://www.budget.pa.gov/PublicationsAndReports/CommonwealthBudget/Documents/2020-21%20Enacted%20Budget/2020-21%20Interim%20Web%20Track.pdf)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (5.94) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 0 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either independently or as a section of the [IT Strategic Approach](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Programs/Information%20Technology/Documents/IT-strategic-plan.pdf). | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 2 out of 6

**Pennsylvania could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud enabling policy in policies (eg, ITP-BUS001 and ITP-BUS011 ), and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Title 62](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=62)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a cloud enabling focus outlined in [policies](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Policies/Pages/itp.aspx) (eg, [ITP-BUS001](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Policies/Documents/itp_bus001.pdf) and [ITP-BUS011](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Policies/Documents/itp_bus011.pdf)) but not in the [IT Strategic Approach](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Programs/Information%20Technology/Documents/IT-strategic-plan.pdf). | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Programs/Information%20Technology/service-catalog/Pages/default.aspx) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 3 out of 8

**Pennsylvania could improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Chief Innovation Architect , it meets one of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, and there is a centralized CISO. If the CIO was a member of the Governor’s cabinet, the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is an Innovation Focused Group led by the [Chief Innovation Architect](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Programs/Information%20Technology/Pages/leadership.aspx) but it is not created by statute. | 1 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | There is no effort that would be considered having met at least one of the three factors that promote successful modernization efforts. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Programs/Information%20Technology/Pages/leadership.aspx) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Programs/Information%20Technology/Pages/leadership.aspx) reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [Executive Order 2016-06](https://www.oa.pa.gov/Policies/eo/Documents/2016-06.pdf)). | 1 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 8
