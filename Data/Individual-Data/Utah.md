# Utah SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Flag_of_Utah.svg/640px-Flag_of_Utah.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 11 out of 21

Utah received **11 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with six states receiving the same number of points (11 out of 21) as Utah.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 3 out of 7

**Utah could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, a dedicated cyber security budget, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is no dedicated cybersecurity budget (see page [5-38](https://le.utah.gov/interim/2020/pdf/00003735.pdf)). | 0 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (5.30) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either independently or as a section of a publicly available IT Strategic Plan. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 4 out of 6

**Utah has a strong IT infrastructure that it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud first statute that prioritizes commercial cloud solutions in 63F-1-104(12), a cloud first strategy in the IT Strategic Plan , and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. By formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially in using commercial cloud solutions for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is a cloud first statute requiring the consideration of cloud solutions in [63F-1-104(12)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63F/Chapter1/63F-1-S104.html). | 2 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | The cloud first statute requires a focus on cloud enablement as a statewide strategy but not in a publicly available version of the [2019-2022 Strategic Plan](https://dts.utah.gov/news/2019-2022-strategic-plan). | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://dts.utah.gov/products-and-services) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 4 out of 8

**Utah has a strong foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Digital Government effort, there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO is a member of the Governor’s cabinet. If the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy and a digital government experience that allowed the Digital Government team to meet the three factors, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is an Innovation Focused Group in the Digital Government team but it is not created by statute. | 1 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | There is no effort that would be considered having met at least one of the three factors that promote successful modernization efforts. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://dts.utah.gov/about-dts/contact-dts) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://dts.utah.gov/news/new-cio-alan-fuller) reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [63F-1-201](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63F/Chapter1/63F-1-S201.html)). | 2 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 8
