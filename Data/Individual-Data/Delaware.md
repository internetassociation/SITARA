# Delaware SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Delaware.svg" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 10 out of 21

Delaware received **10 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with two states receiving the same number of points (10 out of 21) as Delaware.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 3 out of 7

**Delaware could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of public awareness.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has a $2.4M cyber security budget . However, the state has more than the average number of ransomware attacks per million, and while it has a statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in the IT Strategic Plan , it has not been updated since September 2019. With a new IT security strategy that is continuously updated, and greater awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve this metric.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $2.4M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page 11](https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GetPdfDocument?fileAttachmentId=310856)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (9.24) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 0 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is a Statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in the [IT Strategic Plan](https://webfiles.dti.delaware.gov/pdfs/strategicplan/Delaware-Statewide-IT-Strategic-Plan.pdf), but the plan has expired with no updates or progress reports since an update to the [statewide security policy](https://dti.delaware.gov/technology-services/standards-and-policies/#security) on September 2019. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 2 out of 6

**Delaware could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud first strategy in official policy , a focus on cloud enablement in the IT Strategic Plan , and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [29 Del. C. 69](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title29/c069/index.html) and [29 Del. C. 90C](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title29/c090c/sc01/index.html). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a cloud first strategy in [official policy](https://dti.delaware.gov/digital-innovation/cloud-first/) and a focus on cloud enablement in the FY2016-2019 [IT Strategic Plan](https://webfiles.dti.delaware.gov/pdfs/strategicplan/Delaware-Statewide-IT-Strategic-Plan.pdf). | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://dti.delaware.gov/state-agencies-portal/) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 5 out of 8

**Delaware could improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Technology Innovation Council (TIC) , there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO is a member of the Governor’s Cabinet. If the TIC or some other effort with a similar mandate were to be established with a focus on developing a modern digital government experience, the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is an Innovation Focused Group in the [Technology Innovation Council](https://dti.delaware.gov/about-dti/offices/office-chief-technology-officer/project-management/technology-investment-council-tic/) and it is created by statute (see [29 Del. C. 9013C](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title29/c090c/sc01/index.html)). | 2 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | There is no Digital Service Team (DST) but the [Technology Innovation Council](https://dti.delaware.gov/about-dti/offices/office-chief-technology-officer/project-management/technology-investment-council-tic/), which focuses on making all public services more accessible (see [TIC Membership](https://dti.delaware.gov/about-dti/offices/office-chief-technology-officer/project-management/technology-investment-council-tic/)), has the recommended authorities, and provides regular updates on their work, sets the foundation for a successful one. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://dti.delaware.gov/about-dti/offices/office-chief-security-officer/) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://dti.delaware.gov/about-dti/delaware-chief-information-officer/) reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [29 Del. C. 9008C](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title29/c090c/sc01/index.html)). | 2 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 8
