<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Flag_of_North_Dakota.svg/575px-Flag_of_North_Dakota.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 11 out of 21

North Dakota received **11 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with six states receiving the same number of points (11 out of 21) as North Dakota.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 5 out of 7

**North Dakota has an established cyber security posture.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, has a $17.7M cyber security budget , has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million, and has an IT Security Strategy outlined in the IT Strategic Plan . With an increase in the budget and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $17.7M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page 93](https://www.nd.gov/omb/sites/omb/files/documents/agency/financial/state-budgets/docs/budget/appropbook2019-21.pdf)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (5.25) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is a Statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in a section of the [ITD Business Plan](https://www.nd.gov/itd/publications/itd-strategic-plans/itd-business-plan-2021-2023) updated for 2021-23. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 1 out of 6

**North Dakota needs to improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no cloud related prioritization in the form of statute, no formalized cloud related strategy, and no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions, formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, as well as providing a publicly available service catalog, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [IT Procurement Rules](https://www.nd.gov/omb/agency/procurement/it-procurement)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is no cloud enabling [policy](https://www.nd.gov/itd/services/it-procurement) or focus on cloud enablement in the 2021-2023 [IT Strategic Plan](https://www.nd.gov/itd/publications/itd-strategic-plans/itd-business-plan-2021-2023). | 0 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://www.nd.gov/itd/services) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 1 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 5 out of 8

**North Dakota has a strong foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the North Dakota Digital Services , it meets one of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO is a member of the Governor’s cabinet. If the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy and a digital government experience that allowed the North Dakota Digital Services to meet the remaining two factors, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is a Digital Services Team (DST) in the [North Dakota Digital Services](https://www.nd.gov/itd/services/digital-services) but it is not created by statute. | 1 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | The [North Dakota Digital Services](https://www.nd.gov/itd/services/digital-services) team focuses on making all public services more accessible (see projects on homepage). | 1 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://www.nd.gov/itd/about-us/organizational-structure) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://www.nd.gov/itd/about-us/organizational-structure) reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [54-59-03](https://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t54c59.pdf#nameddest=54-59-03)). | 2 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 8
