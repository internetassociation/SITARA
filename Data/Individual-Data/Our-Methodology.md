# Our Methodology

## Cybersecurity Posture

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Statewide IT Security Strategy | The Statewide IT Security Strategy metric examines whether or not there is a coordinated approach towards ensuring all agencies and departments adopt established cyber security best practices. An effective Statewide IT Security Strategy will be either an independent document or a major part of the IT Strategic Plan, will be regularly updated, and include progress reports as part of the information provided. | A yes is worth 1, a no is worth 0.
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) metric examines whether or not a state is a participant in MS-ISAC (Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center) and EI-ISAC (Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing & Analysis Center). These are the two ISACs that the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) recommends every state and territory join as it should provide a baseline level of cybersecurity knowledge. | A yes to both is worth 2, a yes to one is worth 1, and a none is worth 0.
Cybersecurity Budget | The Cybersecurity Budget metric examines whether or not there is a dedicated portion of the approved budget for cybersecurity or information security. Simply spending general funds on these efforts is not enough - there must be a consistent and guaranteed source of funding to maintain the security and resiliency of the government's operations. | The highest percentage allocation in the nation is worth 2, a yes is worth 1, a no is worth 0.
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks Metric examines whether a region is below or above the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to the FBI's Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). Normalizing this number allows for a rough measurement of the cybersecurity maturity level of the general population. | The best result in the nation is worth 2, below the national average is worth 1, above the national average or no reported attacks is worth 0.

## Modern IT Infrastructure

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | The Cloud First Statute metric examines whether or not there is a law in place that requires the prioritization of cloud solutions. Legislation is prioritized, as it is the only way to guarantee there is no reversal of a cloud first effort with a focus on commercial cloud singled out as the optimal way to enable such an effort. | Prioritizing commercial cloud solutions is worth 3, prioritizing a cloud first approach is worth 2, prioritizing cloud in any other manner is worth 1, and no cloud prioritization is worth 0.
Cloud Related Strategy | The Cloud Related Strategy metric examines whether or not there is a cloud related strategy in place (e.g., CIO-based cloud adoption policy, IT Strategic Plan goals, etc.). Some form of cloud adoption or migration plan is the only way to ensure citizens receive their government services in this digital age. | A strategy with a focus on cloud-native applications is worth 2, a focus on cloud enablement is worth 1, a no focus is worth 0.
Service Catalog Availability | The Service Catalog metric examines whether or not there is a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. This ensures better management of software licenses and improves the ability of teams to make cost-effective decisions. | A yes is worth 1, a no is worth 0.
Max Score | Total number of points available in this category. | 6

## Modernization Efficacy

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | The Modernizing Government IT Support metric examines whether or not there is a Digital Services Team (DST), Innovation Focused Group, or another form of a Digital Services Plan that looks at improving resident services through the use of emerging technologies (e.g., data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning) in the state, and if that effort is codified by statute. Modernizing government services often saves money through the use of modern program and project management techniques, internal training and consulting services, and the provision of both educational and technical resources. | An effort that is created by statute is worth 2, having such an effort is worth 1, anything less is worth 0.
Digital Government Experience | The Digital Government Experience metric analyzes how impactful the digital services effort in the state is progressing. Successful digital services have a (1) focus on modernization efforts intended to make all services more accessible to the public (e.g., digital identity, common IT platform, common UX, etc.), (2) all five of the authorities necessary to support a successful modernization effort (authority to provide statewide guidance on IT; a statewide digital strategy; best practices for the procurement of IT; financial control or guidance of IT-related expenditures; along with, workforce training), and (3) a mandate to provide regular reports on the progress of their work. These three factors were derived from best practices that have shown success at both the state and federal levels and in a variety of organizational structures. | An effort receives 1 point for focusing on modernization of digital services intended to make all services more accessible to the public, 1 point for having all five of the authorities necessary to support a successful modernization effort, and 1 point for having a mandate to provide regular reports on the progress of their work.
Centralized CISO Role | The Centralized CISO Role metric examines whether or not there is a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) with authority over all agencies and departments. A CISO with the authority to direct and manage the information security efforts of the entire government is essential to maintaining proper cyber hygiene. | A yes is worth 1, a no is worth 0.
CIO Reports to Governor | The CIO Reports to Governor metric examines whether or not the Chief Information Officer (CIO) reports to and works directly with the Governor. A CIO with the authority to direct and manage the information technology investments of the entire government is essential to providing modern civic services. | A CIO that reports directly to the Governor and is part of the cabinet is worth 2, a CIO that reports directly to the Governor but is not in the cabinet is worth 1, anything else is worth 0.
