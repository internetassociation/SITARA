# Colorado SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Flag_of_Colorado.svg/640px-Flag_of_Colorado.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 11 out of 21

Colorado received **11 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with six states receiving the same number of points (11 out of 21) as Colorado.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 4 out of 7

**Colorado could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of public awareness.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, has a $8.5M cyber security budget , and has an IT security strategy outlined in the Secure Colorado plan. However, the state has more than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With more funding and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $8.5M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see page 143 of the PDF / [Schedule 3D](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1IndwSUN__0PrIxcQfYRKpKXwa_XlLoAL)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (6.95) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 0 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is a Statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in [Secure Colorado](http://oit.state.co.us/securecolorado), which has been updated for FY2020-2022. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 2 out of 6

**Colorado could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud first policy with a focus on cloud enablement in the OIT Cloud Strategy , and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [24-37.5-105](https://advance.lexis.com/documentpage/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=6f7c9a9b-0377-491f-bf59-a866c5c0d225&config=014FJAAyNGJkY2Y4Zi1mNjgyLTRkN2YtYmE4OS03NTYzNzYzOTg0OGEKAFBvZENhdGFsb2d592qv2Kywlf8caKqYROP5&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fstatutes-legislation%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A61W9-XWN1-JKPJ-G3KX-00008-00&pdcontentcomponentid=234176&pdteaserkey=sr0&pditab=allpods&ecomp=L5w_kkk&earg=sr0&prid=f739fe86-829f-48da-98e0-6481a76b19d8)). | 0 out of 3

## Modernization Efficacy

### 5 out of 8

**Colorado has a strong foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Colorado Digital Service , it meets one of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO is a member of the Governor’s cabinet. If the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy and a digital government experience that allowed the Colorado Digital Service to meet the remaining two factors, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring

Modernizing Government IT Support | There is a Digital Service Team (DST) in the [Colorado Digital Service](https://sites.google.com/state.co.us/coloradodigitalservice/home) but it is not created by statute. | 1 out of 2
