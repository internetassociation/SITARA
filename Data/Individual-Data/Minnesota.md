# Minnesota SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Minnesota.svg/500px-Flag_of_Minnesota.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 14 out of 21

Minnesota received **14 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Very Good** and is the highest score in the nation. Three states achieved the same ranking of Very Good, with no other state receiving the same number of points (14 out of 21) as Minnesota.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 4 out of 7

**Minnesota has an established cyber security posture.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, has a $5M cyber security budget , has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. While it has a statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in the Vision 2020 IT Strategic Plan , it has not been updated since 2018. With a new IT security strategy that is continuously updated, and greater awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve this metric.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $5M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page 8](https://mn.gov/mmb-stat/documents/budget/2020-21-biennial-budget-books/enacted-budget/mnit-services.pdf)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (5.32) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is a Statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in the [Information Security Strategic Plan](https://mn.gov/mnit/about-mnit/security/strategic-plan/), but the plan has had no updates or progress reports since 2018. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 5 out of 6

**Minnesota has a solid IT infrastructure foundation.** There is a cloud-first statute that prioritizes commercial cloud solutions in 16E.03(4a) , a focus on cloud enablement as a statewide strategy as a result of the statute, and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a very robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is a cloud first statute prioritizing commercial cloud solutions in [16E.03(4a)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/16E.03). | 3 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | The cloud first statute requires a focus on cloud enablement as a statewide strategy. | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://mn.gov/mnit/government/services/) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 5 out of 8

**Minnesota has a strong foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Minnesota IT Services (MNIT) , there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO has a direct line to the Governor. While MNIT works on providing a modern digital government experience, if it were to stand up a DST or implement the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Council on Information Technology ( BRC-IT ), the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for even more effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is an Innovation Focused Group in [MNIT](https://mn.gov/mnit/) and it is established by statute (see [Ch. 16E](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/16E)) | 2 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | There is no Digital Service Team (DST) but [MNIT](https://mn.gov/mnit/), which focuses on making all public services more accessible (see projects outlined in the [Strategic Plan](https://mn.gov/mnit/about-mnit/strategic-plan/)), has the recommended authorities, and provides regular updates on their work, sets the foundation for a successful one. Furthermore, if the final recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Council on Information Technology ([BRC-IT](https://www.lrl.mn.gov/agencies/detail?AgencyID=2351)) are implemented, an argument could be made that MNIT is itself a DST. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://mn.gov/mnit/about-mnit/leadership/tandon-rohit.jsp) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://mn.gov/mnit/about-mnit/leadership/tarek-tomes.jsp) reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [16E.01](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/16E.01)). | 2 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 8
