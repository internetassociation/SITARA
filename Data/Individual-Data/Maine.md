# Maine SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Flag_of_Maine.svg/609px-Flag_of_Maine.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 8 out of 21

Maine received **8 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with nine states receiving the same number of points (8 out of 21) as Maine.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 3 out of 7

**Maine could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, a dedicated cyber security budget, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is no dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page A-21](https://www.maine.gov/budget/sites/maine.gov.budget/files/inline-files/GF%202020%202021%20Part%20A.pdf)). | 0 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (5.21) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either independently or as a section of any publicly available IT Strategic Plan. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 2 out of 6

**Maine could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud enabling policy in the COTS Cloud Policy , and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Chapter 155](https://mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/5/title5ch155sec0.html)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a cloud enabling policy outlined in [COTS Cloud Policy](https://www.maine.gov/oit/sites/maine.gov.oit/files/inline-files/cots-cloud-policy.pdf) but there is no strategic plan. | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://www.maine.gov/oit/services) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 3 out of 8

**Maine could improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Governor's Office of Policy Innovation and the Future (GOPIF), it meets one of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, and there is a centralized CISO. If the CIO was a member of the Governor’s cabinet, the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is an Innovation Focused Group in the Governor's Office of Policy Innovation and the Future ([GOPIF](https://www.maine.gov/future/)) and it is created by statute (see [Title 5, Chapter 310](http://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/5/title5ch310sec0.html)). | 2 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | The Governor's Office of Policy Innovation and the Future ([GOPIF](https://www.maine.gov/future/)), which provides regular updates on their work, sets part of the foundation for a successful one. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://www.maine.gov/oit/sites/maine.gov.oit/files/inline-files/it-leadership-org-chart.pdf) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://www.maine.gov/dafs/about/leadership/fred-brittain) does not report to or work directly with the Governor as they are located under the Department of Administrative and Financial Services ([DAFS](https://www.maine.gov/dafs/)) (see [5-1971](http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/5/title5ch163sec0.html)). | 0 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 8
