<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Flag_of_New_York.svg/640px-Flag_of_New_York.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 8 out of 21

New York received **8 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with nine states receiving the same number of points (8 out of 21) as New York.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 3 out of 7

**New York could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, a dedicated cyber security budget, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is no dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [Budget](https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/archive/fy21/enac/fy21-enacted-cpfp.pdf)). | 0 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (4.42) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either [independently](https://its.ny.gov/welcome-nys-chief-information-security-office) or as a section of an IT Strategic Plan. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 1 out of 6

**New York needs to improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no cloud related prioritization in the form of statute or a focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying prioritization for formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Procurement Rules](https://its.ny.gov/nys-procurement-rules-and-guidelines)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is no focus on cloud enablement in [policies](https://its.ny.gov/document/process-establishing-enterprise-information-technology-standards) or [statutes](https://its.ny.gov/laws-regulations-and-notices). | 0 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://its.ny.gov/service-rates) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 1 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 4 out of 8

**New York could improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** The CIO is a member of the Governor’s Cabinet, there is a centralized CISO, and there is support for modernization in the New York State Digital Service . However, as the New York State Digital Service just started, there is nothing to review in terms of their efforts towards achieving a modern digital government experience. If the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy and a digital government experience that meets at least one of the three factors of a modern one, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is a Digital Services Team (DST) in the [New York State Digital Service](https://ogs.ny.gov/new-york-state-digital-service) but it is not created by statute. | 1 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | The [New York State Digital Service](https://ogs.ny.gov/new-york-state-digital-service) has just started so it does not have a portfolio of projects to review and the authorities and reporting regularity will be determined after the pilot program has progressed further. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://its.ny.gov/welcome-nys-chief-information-security-office) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The CIO (called CTO in NYS) reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [STT 102](http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:)). | 2 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 8
