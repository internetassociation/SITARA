<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Alabama.svg/320px-Flag_of_Alabama.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 11 out of 21

Georgia received **11 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with six states receiving the same number of points (11 out of 21) as Georgia.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 5 out of 7

**Georgia has an established cyber security posture.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, has a $6.1M cyber security budget , has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million, and has an IT Security Strategy outlined in the IT Strategic Plan 2025 . With an increase in the budget and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $6.1M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page 125](https://opb.georgia.gov/document/document/hb-793-fy-2021-appropriations-bill/download)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (3.67) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is a Statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in the [IT Strategic Plan 2025](https://gta.georgia.gov/enterprise-governance-and-planning-main-page/it-strategic-plan-2025). | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 2 out of 6

**Georgia could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a focus on cloud enablement in the IT Strategic Plan 2025 , and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Title 50, Chapter 5, Article 3](https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/georgia_code_-_lexisnexis)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a focus on cloud enablement in the [IT Strategic Plan 2025](https://gta.georgia.gov/enterprise-governance-and-planning-main-page/it-strategic-plan-2025). | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://gta.georgia.gov/gta-services/gta-direct-services) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 4 out of 8

**Georgia could improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by Digital Services Georgia , it meets two of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, and there is a centralized CISO. If the CIO was a member of the Governor’s cabinet, and the Digital Services Georgia were given the ability to meet the other factor, the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is a Digital Services Team (DST) in [Digital Services Georgia](https://digitalservices.georgia.gov/) but it is not created by statute. | 1 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | [Digital Services Georgia](https://digitalservices.georgia.gov/) focuses on making all public services more accessible (see [projects](https://digitalservices.georgia.gov/our-work)) and provides regular updates on their work through their position in the [Georgia Technology Authority](https://gta.georgia.gov/purpose). | 2 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://gta.georgia.gov/david-allen) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://gta.georgia.gov/calvin-c-rhodes) does not report to or works directly with the Governor, as they report to the Department of Administrative Services (see [50-25-3](https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/georgia_code_-_lexisnexis)). | 0 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 8
