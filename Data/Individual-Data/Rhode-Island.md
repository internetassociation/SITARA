<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Rhode_Island.svg/546px-Flag_of_Rhode_Island.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 7 out of 21

Rhode Island received **7 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Getting Started**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Getting Started, with thirteen states receiving the same number of points (7 out of 21) as Rhode Island.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 2 out of 7

**Rhode Island needs to improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS. However, the state does not have a dedicated cyber security budget, and it has more than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, a dedicated cyber security budget, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is no dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [Budget](http://www.omb.ri.gov/documents/Prior%20Year%20Budgets/Operating%20Budget%202020/0_FY%202020%20Capital%20Budget.pdf)). | 0 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (8.50) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 0 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is a Statewide IT Security Strategy outlined in the [State Cybersecurity Strategy](http://www.admin.ri.gov/documents/Reports/cybersecurity/RI%20Cybersecurity%20Strategy%202019.pdf), but the plan has had no updates since 2019. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 1 out of 6

**Rhode Island needs to improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud first strategy in Digital Strategy . However, there is no cloud related prioritization in the form of statute, and no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions, formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, as well as providing a publicly available service catalog, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Procurement Statutes and Regulations](https://www.ridop.ri.gov/rules-regulations/)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a cloud smart policy outlined in the [IT Annual Report](http://www.doit.ri.gov/Documents/Enterprise-Technology-Strategy-and-Services-(ETSS)-Annual-Report-2019.pdf). | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 1 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 4 out of 8

**Rhode Island could improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** The CIO is a member of the Governor’s Cabinet, there is a centralized CISO, and there is support for modernization in the Agency & Enterprise Applications . However, as they have no projects for review, there is nothing to review in terms of their efforts towards achieving a modern digital government experience. If the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy and a digital government experience that meets at least one of the three factors of a modern one, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is an Innovation Focused Group in the [Agency & Enterprise Applications](http://www.doit.ri.gov/Services/Applications.php) group but it is not created by statute. | 1 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | There is no Digital Service Team (DST) but the [Agency & Enterprise Applications](http://www.doit.ri.gov/Services/Applications.php) group, which focuses on making all public services more accessible, sets part of the foundation to build a successful one. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](http://www.doit.ri.gov/Services/Security.php) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The CIO reports to the Chief Digital Officer (CDO), who reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [42-11-2.8](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE42/42-11/42-11-2.8.HTM)). Considering both the [CIO and CDO](http://www.doit.ri.gov/about/index.php) roles are filled by the same person, it is technically accurate to state that Rhode Island's CIO currently reports to and works directly with the Governor. | 2 out of 2
