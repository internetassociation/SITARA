<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Flag_of_Vermont.svg/640px-Flag_of_Vermont.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 12 out of 21

Vermont received **12 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with three states receiving the same number of points (12 out of 21) as Vermont.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 5 out of 7

**Vermont could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of public funding.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million, and has an IT security strategy outlined in the Strategic Plan . With a dedicated cyber security budget, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is no dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page 1](https://finance.vermont.gov/sites/finance/files/FY2021%20AFDETA.pdf)). | 0 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (1.60) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 2 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is a Statewide IT Security Strategy outlined as a section of the [Strategic Plan](https://strategicplan.vermont.gov/sites/strategicplan/files/documents/agency-plans/ADS_SP.pdf) updated for 2018-2023. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 0 out of 6

**Vermont needs to improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is no cloud related prioritization in the form of statute, no formalized cloud related strategy, and no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions, formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, as well as providing a publicly available service catalog, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Title 29](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/title/29)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is no focus on cloud enablement outlined in [policies](https://digitalservices.vermont.gov/working-us/policies), [guidelines](https://bgs.vermont.gov/sites/bgs/files/files/purchasing-contracting/Technology%20Handbook%20-%20FINAL%20-%2004-01-19.pdf), [procedures](https://aoa.vermont.gov/bulletins/3point5), or the Agency of Digital Services 2018-2023 [Strategic Plan](https://strategicplan.vermont.gov/sites/strategicplan/files/documents/agency-plans/ADS_SP.pdf). | 0 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is no publicly available inventory ([it is private](https://digitalservices.vermont.gov/working-us/services)) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 0 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 7 out of 8

**Vermont has a strong foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Agency of Digital Services , it meets two of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO is a member of the Governor’s cabinet. the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for effective modernization efforts. If the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy and a digital government experience that allowed the Agency of Digital Services to meet the remaining factor, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is a Digital Services Team (DST) in the [Agency of Digital Services](https://digitalservices.vermont.gov/priorities) and it is created by statute (see [Title 3, Chapter 56](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/chapter/03/056)). | 2 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | The [Agency of Digital Services](https://digitalservices.vermont.gov/priorities) has the recommended authorities and provides regular updates on their work. | 2 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://digitalservices.vermont.gov/about-us/how-we-are-organized) role. | 1 out of 1
