# STATE SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Flag_of_Missouri.svg/640px-Flag_of_Missouri.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 6 out of 21

STATE received **6 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Getting Started**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Getting Started, with seven states receiving the same number of points (6 out of 21) as Missouri.

*For more information on how metrics are measured and scores are designated, please read [Our Methodology](https://github.com/internetassociation/SITARA/blob/main/Data/Individual-Data/Our-Methodology.md).*

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 4 out of 7

**Missouri could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, has a $9M cyber security budget , and has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $9M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page 4](https://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills201/hlrbillspdf/2005H.06T.pdf)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (4.89) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either independently or as a section of the IT Strategic Plan. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 1 out of 6

**Missouri needs to improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no cloud related prioritization in the form of statute, no formalized cloud related strategy, and no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions, formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, as well as providing a publicly available service catalog, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Chapter 34](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneChapter.aspx?chapter=34)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is no cloud enabling policy outlined in ITSD's [policies](https://oa.mo.gov/commissioners-office/policies/statewide). | 0 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://oa.mo.gov/itsd/it-governance) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 1 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 1 out of 8

**Missouri needs to improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a centralized CISO. However, there is no support for modernizing government IT, there is no formal effort to implement a digital government experience, and the CIO does not have a direct line to the Governor. If the CIO was a member of the Governor’s cabinet, the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy, and the state had a digital government experience that meets at least one of the three factors of a modern one, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is no effort that would be considered a Digital Services Team (DST), Innovation Focused Group, or Digital Services Plan. | 0 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | There is no effort that would be considered having met at least one of the three factors that promote successful modernization efforts. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://oa.mo.gov/itsd/it-governance/information-security) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://oa.mo.gov/itsd/about-itsd) does not report to or work directly with the Governor as they are located under the Office of Administration (see [37.110](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=37.110&bid=1023&hl=)). | 0 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 1 out of 8
