# Arizona SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Flag_of_Arizona.svg/320px-Flag_of_Arizona.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 8 out of 21

Arizona received **8 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty-five states achieved the same ranking with ten states receiving the same number of points as Arizona.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 4 out of 7

**Arizona could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, has a $11.6M cyber security budget , and has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $11.6M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see page 12). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (5.96) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either independently or as a section of the [IT Strategic Plan](https://aset.az.gov/strategic-plan). | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 3 out of 6

**Arizona could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud first policy in PI1100 and an effort to migrate to the cloud in the IT Strategic Plan , and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in the cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Chapter 23](https://spo.az.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/Arizona%20Procurement%20Code%20%28Combined%20-%20Effective%20July%202020%29.pdf)). | 0
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a cloud first policy outlined in [P1100](https://aset.az.gov/p1100-cloud-first-policy-11) and a focus on developing cloud-native applications in the [2017-2020 IT Strategic Plan](https://aset.az.gov/2017-2020-plan). | 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://aset.az.gov/service-catalog) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3

## Modernization Efficacy

### 1 out of 8

**Arizona needs to improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a centralized CISO. However, there is no support for modernizing government IT, there is no formal effort to implement a digital government experience, and the CIO does not have a direct line to the Governor. If the CIO was a member of the Governor’s cabinet, the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy, and the state had a digital government experience that meets at least one of the three factors of a modern one, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is no effort that would be considered a Digital Services Team (DST), Innovation Focused Group, or Digital Services Plan. | 0 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | There is no effort that would be considered having met at least one of the three factors that promote successful modernization efforts. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://doa.az.gov/tim-roemer) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://aset.az.gov/jr-sloan) does not report to or work directly with the Governor as ADOA-ASET is under the [Department of Administration](https://doa.az.gov/leadership-staff) (see [ARS 41-702](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/41/00702.htm)). | 0 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 1 out of 8
