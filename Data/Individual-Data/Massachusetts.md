# Massachusetts SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Flag_of_Massachusetts.svg/640px-Flag_of_Massachusetts.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 11 out of 21

Massachusetts received **11 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with six states receiving the same number of points (11 out of 21) as Massachusetts.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 4 out of 7

**Massachusetts could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has a $950k cyber security budget , and has less than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $950k available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget in the form of a Cybersecurity Innovation Fund (see [page 22](https://www.mass.gov/doc/account-listing/download)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is below (5.08) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 1 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either independently or as a section of the IT Strategic Plan or [policies and standards](https://www.mass.gov/handbook/enterprise-information-security-policies-and-standards). | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 2 out of 6

**Massachusetts could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud enabling policy in IS.012 , and a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority, and no focus on developing cloud-native applications in a cloud strategy. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions as well as formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [7D, Section 7](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter7D/Section7)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a cloud enabling policy outlined in policy (see section 6.7 of [IS.012](https://www.mass.gov/doc/is012-operations-management-standard/download)) but no strategic plan. | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://www.mass.gov/resource/eotss-end-user-software-and-service-catalog) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 5 out of 8

**Massachusetts has a foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Massachusetts Digital Services , it meets one of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO is a member of the Governor’s Cabinet. If the Massachusetts Digital Services were given the ability to meet the other two factors, the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is a Digital Services Team in the [Massachusetts Digital Service](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-digital-service) led by the Chief Digital Officer, which is a position established by statute (see [7D, Section 4C](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter7D/Section4C)), but the team itself is not codified. | 1 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | The [Massachusetts Digital Service](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-digital-service) focuses on making all public services more accessible (see [projects](https://medium.com/massgovdigital)). | 1 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/01/10/EOTSSLeadership%201_2019.pdf) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://www.mass.gov/person/curtis-m-wood-secretary-and-chief-information-officer) reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [7D, Section 2](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter7D/Section2) and [6A, Section 7A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter6A/Section7A)) | 2 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 5 out of 8
