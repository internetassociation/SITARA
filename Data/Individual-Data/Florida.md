# Florida SITARA Scorecard

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Flag_of_Florida.svg/640px-Flag_of_Florida.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 13 out of 21

Florida received **13 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Very Good** and has it tied for second highest score in the nation. Only two other states achieved the same ranking of Very Good, with one state receiving the same number of points (13 out of 21) as Florida.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 2 out of 7

**Florida needs to improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS. However, the state does not have a dedicated cyber security budget, and it has more than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, a dedicated cyber security budget, and a bit more awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve these metrics.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | While millions have been appropriated to cybersecurity efforts, there is no dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [CIO budget](http://www.bolderbrighterbetterfuture.com/web%20forms/Budget/BudgetIssueDetail.aspx?ndx=0&si=72900700&pc=1603000000&icd=1001000&icnt=12&recnum=4&title=ESTIMATED%20EXPENDITURES%20-%20OPERATIONS)). | 0 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (6.80) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 0 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either independently or as a section of an IT Strategic Plan. While there may be one in the Office of Information Technology [Standards and Procedures](https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/oit/service-delivery-framework/standardsprocedures), but the links are either private or not working. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 2 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 4 out of 6

**Florida has a strong IT infrastructure that it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a cloud first statute that prioritizes commercial cloud solutions in 282.206 and a cloud first strategy as a result. However, there is no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. By formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, as well as providing a publicly available service catalog, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is a cloud first statute prioritizing commercial cloud solutions in [Chapter 60G-4](https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ChapterHome.asp?Chapter=60GG-4) and [282.206](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0200-0299/0282/Sections/0282.206.html). | 3 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | The cloud first statute requires a focus on cloud enablement as a statewide strategy. | 1 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 4 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 7 out of 8

**Florida has a strong foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Florida Digital Service , it meets two of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, there is a centralized CISO, and the CIO is a member of the Governor’s cabinet. However, as the Florida Digital Service just started, there is nothing to review in terms of their efforts towards achieving a modern digital government experience. If the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy and a digital government experience that meets the remaining factor of a modern one, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is a Digital Services Team (DST) in the [Florida Digital Service](https://digital.fl.gov/) and it is created by statute (see [20.22](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0000-0099/0020/Sections/0020.22.html) and [HB1391](https://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_h1391er.docx&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=1391&Session=2020)). | 2 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | The [Florida Digital Service](https://digital.fl.gov/) has just started so it does not have a portfolio of projects to review, but it has the recommended authorities, and provides regular updates on their work. | 2 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a statewide [CISO](https://www.dms.myflorida.com/content/download/97128/565060/1-0_Dept_of_Management_Services_Overview_with_Names_20-21_FY.pdf) role (though it is currently vacant). | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://www.dms.myflorida.com/content/download/97128/565060/1-0_Dept_of_Management_Services_Overview_with_Names_20-21_FY.pdf) reports to and works directly with the Governor (see [282.0051(2)(a)](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0200-0299/0282/Sections/0282.0051.html)). | 2 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 7 out of 8
