<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Flag_of_the_District_of_Columbia.svg/640px-Flag_of_the_District_of_Columbia.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 6 out of 21

District of Columbia received **6 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Getting Started**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Getting Started, with seven states receiving the same number of points (6 out of 21) as DC.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 3 out of 7

**DC could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of public awareness.** The District is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has a $9.8M cyber security budget . However, the District has more than the average number of ransomware attacks per million and does not have an IT security strategy. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, and greater awareness among the District’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve this metric.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $9.8M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page A-196](https://app.box.com/s/d01ut3gjwvcki7ssbct3v67dhppeai4p)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (7.08) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 0 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy yet, but a section of the [IT Strategic Plan](https://techplan.dc.gov/node/1441991) requires the development of one. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 0 out of 6

**DC needs to improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is no cloud related prioritization in the form of statute, no formalized cloud related strategy, and no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the District’s IT infrastructure. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions, formalizing the need for developing cloud-native applications, especially for resident-facing services, as well as providing a publicly available service catalog, the District would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Chapter 3A](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/titles/2/chapters/3A/) and [Chapter 3B](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/titles/2/chapters/3B/)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is no formalized cloud related strategy in policy (see [OCTO Policies](https://octo.dc.gov/page/it-policies)), but there is a call to create one soon in the [IT Strategic Plan](https://techplan.dc.gov/). | 0 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is no publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 0 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 3 out of 8

**DC could improve its foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** The CIO is a member of the Mayor’s Cabinet, and there is a centralized CISO. However, there is no support for modernizing government IT and no formal effort to implement a digital government experience. If the state had executive-level support for their modernization strategy and a digital government experience that meets at least one of the three factors of a modern one, the state would have a framework for an effective IT modernization effort.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is no effort that would be considered a Digital Services Team (DST), Innovation Focused Group, or Digital Services Plan. | 0 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | There is no effort that would be considered having met at least one of the three factors that promote successful modernization efforts. | 0 out of 3
Centralized CISO Role  | There is a districtwide [CISO](https://octo.dc.gov/release/dc-names-new-chief-information-security-officer-ciso) role. | 1 out of 1
CIO Reports to Governor | The [CIO](https://octo.dc.gov/biography/lindsey-parker) reports to and works directly with the Mayor (see [1-1401](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/1-1401.html#:~:text=D.C.%20Law%20Library%20%2D%20%C2%A7%201,of%20the%20Chief%20Technology%20Officer.)). | 2 out of 2
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 8
