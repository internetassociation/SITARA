<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg/512px-Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg.png" width="100" />

SITARA examines a variety of data points that are relevant to IT modernization discussions as well as cybersecurity maturity. With an established baseline of participation in programs recommended by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), SITARA measures additional efforts that will help governments focus on current and future threats related to the use of IT equipment and services while also moving towards developing a digital and more accessible set of services built on a modern infrastructure.

## Total Score

### 11 out of 21

New Jersey received **11 out of 21**, which gives it a ranking of **Good**. Twenty four states achieved the same ranking of Good, with six states receiving the same number of points (11 out of 21) as New Jersey.

## Cybersecurity Posture

### 3 out of 7

**New Jersey could improve its cyber security posture, especially in terms of strategy.** The state is a member of the two recommended ISACs in CIS, and has a $4.9M cyber security budget . However, the state has more than the average number of ransomware attacks per million. With an IT security strategic plan that is continuously updated, and greater awareness among the state’s residents and businesses as well as greater messaging around the need for continuous backups and patching of software and hardware for anyone who has sensitive data, the state may be able to improve this metric.

Metric | Source | Score
--- | --- | ---
Cybersecurity Budget | There is $4.9M available as a dedicated cybersecurity budget (see [page 132](https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/AL20/97_.pdf)). | 1 out of 2
Member of Center for Internet Security (CIS) | The state is a participant in both [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/partners-state-government/) and [EI-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac/partners-ei-isac/). | 2 out of 2
IC3 Confirmed Ransomware Attacks | The state is above (7.54) the national number of ransomware attacks per million (5.80) as reported to IC3. | 0 out of 2
Statewide IT Security Strategy | There is no Statewide IT Security Strategy, either independently or as a section of the [IT Strategic Plan](https://nj.gov/it/docs/NJOIT_Strategic_Plan_2020_gab.pdf). | 0 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 7

## Modern IT Infrastructure

### 3 out of 6

**New Jersey could improve the IT infrastructure it provides state employees, especially for those teams that develop and deliver services to the public.** There is a focus on developing cloud-native applications in the IT Strategic Plan , and there is a publicly available inventory of software that is approved for use in the state’s IT infrastructure. However, there is no statute that establishes a cloud related priority. By codifying a cloud-first policy that promotes the use of commercial cloud solutions, the state would provide a far more robust IT environment.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Cloud First Statute | There is no cloud related prioritization established by statute (see [Procurement Code](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/purchase/AdminCode.shtml)). | 0 out of 3
Cloud Related Strategy | There is a focus on developing cloud-native applications in the 2020-2022 [IT Strategic Plan](https://nj.gov/it/docs/NJOIT_Strategic_Plan_2020_gab.pdf). | 2 out of 2
Service Catalog Availability | There is a [publicly available inventory](https://nj.gov/it/whatwedo/governance/) of software that is approved for use in the state's IT infrastructure. | 1 out of 1
Score | Total number of points received. | 3 out of 6

## Modernization Efficacy

### 5 out of 8

**New Jersey has a foundation for an effective and impactful modernization effort.** There is a supported modernization effort being led by the Office of Innovation , it meets one of the three factors of a modern digital government experience, the CIO is a member of the Governor’s Cabinet. If the Office of Innovation were given the ability to meet the other two factors, the state would have a framework in which leadership level support would allow for effective modernization efforts.

Metric | Definition | Scoring
--- | --- | ---
Modernizing Government IT Support | There is a Digital Services Team (DST) in the [Office of Innovation](https://innovation.nj.gov/) but it is not created by statute. | 1 out of 2
Digital Government Experience | The [Office of Innovation](https://innovation.nj.gov/) focuses on making all public services more accessible (see [projects](https://innovation.nj.gov/projects.html)). | 1 out of 3
